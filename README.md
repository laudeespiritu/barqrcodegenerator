# BarQrCodeGenerator

## Intro

BarQRCodeGenerator is a simple app written in C# that generates both Barcodes and QR Codes. To achieve its intended functionalities, it is powered by two libraries: [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder#qrcoder) and [BarcodeLib](https://github.com/barnhill/barcodelib#barcodelib--).

After you've checked out this project, you can already use it! Just don't forget to build it first through Visual Studio.
